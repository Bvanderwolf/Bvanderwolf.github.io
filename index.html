                    Hunter Gatherers is a multiplayer real-time strategy game in which you try to survive on a island
                    that is flooding. Your goal is
                    to be the last tribe standing. You gather resources, place down your camp to rest and craft, and
                    then pack it back up to outrun
                    the flood. The game was made for a schoolproject with a team of 4 in 8 weeks, and is to continued by
                    future student
                    teams.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the project my main job was to provide the multiplayer functionalities to the game. This
                    included connecting and joining
                    rooms, seperated player properties, raising events, synchonization of game objects, pooling and
                    raising of request. I wrapped
                    all these functionalities into one big wrapper class to make switching multiplayer libraries a lot
                    easier aswell. Additionaly, i
                    worked on juicing the game with things like particles, animations and the like.

                    How do I create a 2d multiplayer racing game with lag and packet loss compensation and
                    desync-avoidance?
                    This was the research
                    question i posed for a school assignment i did as a GameDevelopment student at the University Of
                    Applied Sciences in Amsterdam. To find this out i
                    took a look at the Photon Unity3D Networking Framework and created a project using Photon for the
                    Unity
                    Engine, to research this
                    very topic.

                  <p>
                    During the project i researched a variety of subjects:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Multiplayer programming using the Photon Framework</li>
                    <li>DeadReckoning</li>
                    <li>2D Game Development in Unity</li>

                    an employee at ING after which another intern group juiced up the game with animations, updated

                    want to play. Programmed in C#, this project was meant to try to out some new techniques i had
                    learned.
