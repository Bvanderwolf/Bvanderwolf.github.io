								<h2>Introduction:</h2>

								<p>During my work as a game developer in the
								Unity Game Engine, I have used a certain design pattern more so than any other.
								The Singleton Pattern is probably one of the easiest patterns out there. It is
								part of the category of creational patterns, meaning it is a pattern related to
								the creation of objects.</p>

								<p>I have found, during my work, that there
								are some serious problems when using this pattern together with Unity’s
								MonoBehaviour class. In this essay I will give a short introduction of the
								singleton pattern, lay out it’s basic implementations and then argue why I
								think its short term ease of use is not worth the variety of problems it causes
								in later stages of development.</p>

								<p>At the end I will give multiple alternative
								approaches which are more scalable and don’t run into the same problems default
								singleton implementations do.</p>

								<h2>A short intro into the
								singleton pattern</h2>

								<p>The use of a singleton pattern is easily
								identified by the implementation of a static “instance” member variable.
								According to the pattern there can only be one instance available. In order to
								do this the instance variable is only set once, when it’s value is null.</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/bfbb41e4343c3b8bd9ad4352607f548e.js"></script>		

								<p>The basis idea of the singleton pattern is
								to have this <b>one</b> instance provide a global connection for other objects
								to use.</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/0e8d8ac03aad5e4f5b39046b1d669995.js"></script>

								<p>Almost always when you are creating a game
								in Unity you want some component (mostly managers/systems/services) to be
								globally available for managing a single responsibility. Since the singleton
								pattern (unlike static classes) provides you with the option to derive from
								other classes, a singleton that derives from the monobehaviour class looks like
								the perfect solution.</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/775375de4d148b2681673decd44b6a66.js"></script>

								<p>Because of the way MonoBehaviour instances
								are created in the editor according to Unity’s <a
								href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingAndUsingScripts.html"><span
								style='color:#1155CC '>Anatomy of a Script File</span></a>, the instance value
								must now be assigned in the Awake method instead of the getter. If your script
								is attached to a game object in a scene and that scene is loaded, the Awake
								function will be called and can thus be used to either assign the instance or
								destroy the game object to which your singleton class is attached.</p>

								<p>After assigning itself to the static
								instance variable, the DontDestroyOnLoad method is used to ensure that your
								singleton is persistent across multiple scenes. That is, it won’t be destroyed
								when a new scene is loaded.</p>

								<h2>An indication of underlying
								problems</h2>

								<p>If you look at a real world example of a
								singleton implementation, at first there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with
								the code. There are actually a lot of people providing code like this on
								websites like <a
								href="https://github.com/Goodgulf281/Unity-Formation-Movement/blob/master/Scripts/Utilities/Singleton.cs"><span
								style='color:#1155CC'>github</span></a>, including myself I will say. But if
								you look closely, there seem to be some restrictive measures added to make sure
								everything works alright. Let's look at an example of this:</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/fcd89346db07ed51179b064b18afc37d.js"></script>

								<h3>The appIsQuitting flag</h3>

								<p>The appIsQuitting member variable is
								supposed to protect the script from throwing a MissingReferenceException. This
								can happen when other scripts try to access the singleton, after it has already
								been destroyed. Most of the time the code that causes these types of error’s
								resides inside the OnDestroy function, which is called when an object is being
								destroyed. This is why this value is set to true, in
								the singleton’s OnDestroy method. If appIsQuitting is true, a null reference
								can be returned instead of throwing this exception.</p>

								<p>Sadly, this doesn’t really solve the issue
								at hand. It is still possible to get a MissingReferenceException if another
								script’s OnDestroy method is called before our singleton’s. You could manually
								change the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MonoManager.html"><span
								style='color:#1155CC'>order of execution</span></a> though, an action that has
								to be undertaken each new project for each new singleton class and can also
								cause your code to be susceptible to errors that are hard to track down.</p>

								<p>In addition, a null reference will still be
								returned, which needs to be taken care of. Be ready to provide all your code
								that uses this singleton with if statements and <a
								href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operators#null-conditional-operators--and-"><span
								style='color:#1155CC'>null conditional operators</span></a> to handle this
								probable event.</p>

								<h3>The isDuplicate flag</h3>

								<p>Another problem can and will probably occur
								when your singleton returns to the original scene it was put in. It is related
								to there being a duplicate which needs to be dealt with.</p>

								<img src="../ReadmeImages/WithoutBootstrap.png" alt="">

								<p>Unless you use some form of lazy
								initialization or bootstrap function or scene, which i will both cover later
								on, you can’t really avoid this conflict.</p>

								<p>The first line of defense for this conflict
								resides inside the Awake function and is to either override the original
								singleton with the duplicate one or just destroy the duplicate. The latter is
								used most and will also be shown in this example:</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/cfb4dd76978b6e1c5a552bcd86d5ea9b.js"></script>

								<p>The question here might be: what function
								does the isDuplicate flag serve here? Well, it is a response to another problem
								that happens when an object gets destroyed. Destroying an object in Unity using
								the Destroy method makes sure the object “is destroyed immediately after the
								current Update loop” according to the <a
								href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Destroy.html"><span
								style='color:#1155CC'>Unity Documentation</span></a>. This means that any other
								code in Awake will still be executed. Even if the object is being destroyed.
								You could add a return statement after Destroying but it would still mean that
								a generic implementation of the singleton pattern in this way is pretty
								difficult..</p>

								<p>Returning the base Awake function doesn’t
								stop the overridden implementation of the derived class to still execute:</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/bcbe887363062e47c610974ca215eaf0.js"></script>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/e1f0bc8f5fe627259def7ff38a7d75b6.js"></script>

								<p>You will now have to use the isDuplicate
								flag to check in your awake function if you can actually run the code. Don't
								forget you will have to do this for <b>each</b> new singleton implementation.</p>

								<p>Having these kinds of limitations and constraints
								on development will definitely impact the product quality and the workflow.</p>

								<h2>Other Development problems</h2>

								<p>Working with this default form of singleton
								behaviour, I encountered additional problems during development. These are
								problems that have a solution, but require the developer to do additional
								testing/research to provide that solution during development for each instance
								of a problem with an implementation. </p>

								<h3>Rigid connections</h3>

								<p>Let's say you are creating a game. You
								created some enemies, a hero and some managers to handle popups, audio and
								pooling of game objects. You have your main menu scene, containing all your
								singleton objects. They are set to not be destroyed on load and thus you can
								use these managers in your battle scene, where the hero fights the enemies.</p>

								<p>You have been getting some feedback from
								friends and you want to readjust some values inside your battle scene. You
								start up the battle scene and your console starts to turn red. Null reference
								errors. It seems your popup manager instance is null because it has not been
								created yet. After adding your popup manager you still get a null reference
								error. This time it is inside your popup manager. Your popup is supposed to
								make a sound but the audio manager is not created yet.</p>

								<p>This typical scenario might be very much
								recognisable to some developers. This string of dependencies can make a pretty
								good day, pretty bad very quick. It also means, creating some sort of test
								environment is going to involve a lot of sighs and moans.</p>

								<h3>Order of execution</h3>

								<p>Singleton behaviours just like any other
								monobehaviour class will need to initialize themselves.. Setting the instance
								variable will need to happen as soon as possible which happens in the Awake
								function. This leaves only the Start function open for other monobehaviour
								classes to interact with our singleton during initialization.</p>

								<p>OnEnable sadly cannot be used for this if
								you look at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html"><span
								style='color:#1155CC'>the Unity Execution order manual</span></a>. Awake and
								OnEnable are called on each object before start is called which means if your
								monobehaviour class is first in the script execution order its OnEnable
								function will still be called earlier than your singleton’s Awake. This means
								another restrained on code structure.</p>

								<h2>Alternatives</h2>

								<p>Luckily there is a large variety of
								implementations for the singleton pattern in unity. Each solves at least one
								problem with the default implementation of a singleton, but in return comes
								with its own set of problems.</p>

								<h3>Lazy initialization</h3>

								<p>Lazy initialization provides solutions to
								the problem of rigid connections, order of execution and the duplication
								problem.. It does this by providing an on demand version of the normal
								singleton behaviour. A simple example:</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/02a4b91e3404a35212845f479f01ca68.js"></script>

								<p>By creating the game object and assigning
								your instance member the added component value, the instance will always be
								available whenever it is needed. In the case of the rigid connection problem,
								it will first create the popup manager when it is needed and then create the
								audio manager since it will be needed for the popup manager to work. No need
								anymore to drag prefabs into test scenes or setting your singleton scripts to
								execute before the default time.</p>

								<p>To top it off there is even a generic <a
								href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.lazy-1?view=net-5.0"><span
								style='color:#1155CC'>Lazy class</span></a> in the System namespace providing a
								flexible and easy to use implementation of this initialization method. This can
								be implemented for example like so:</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/0e61cd6a94657943a5055f27c31dcded.js"></script>

								<p>But of course, it is not all positives.
								There is one major downside to this method. That is, it’s use of serialized
								fields. Because we are lazily instantiating this singleton, we can’t set scene
								or project references like with monobehaviours in scenes or prefabs. When our
								singleton game object is created, because we add the component to it, only the
								default values are copied. This means in this example, the data string contains
								the value data and sceneInfo will be null even if you set these values inside a
								prefab or scene.</p>

								<img src="../img/rapports/Singletons/snippet lazy singleton.png" alt="">

								<p>I should say that there is atleast one way
								to circumvent this problem, but it is not a pretty one: using the Resources
								folder. This method is also used by another alternative and uses the Resources
								folder to load singleton prefabs into the scene during runtime. The not so
								pretty part is that you do this only once and the Resources folder is notorious
								for causing many problems when not used properly, as indicated by <a
								href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BestPracticeUnderstandingPerformanceInUnity6.html"><span
								style='color:#1155CC'>Unity its Manual on the Resources folder</span></a>.</p>

								<p>The way this is implemented is pretty easy.
								All you do is create a prefab of your singleton game object with your lazy
								singleton behaviour attached and its references set. Make sure it is inside a
								folder named “Resources”, then you use the Resources.Load method to Instantiate
								a copy of this prefab into the scene.</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/3d82b7c2a3056a0850967530c831ca2e.js"></script>

								<h3>The Bootstrap function</h3>

								<p>Using C# attributes, Unity provides a <a
								href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute.html"><span
								style='color:#1155CC'>RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute </span></a>class.
								This attribute class is applicable to a function. This function will be called
								after Awake or based on the given <a
								href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RuntimeInitializeLoadType.html"><span
								style='color:#1155CC'>RuntimeInitializeLoadType</span></a> value, based on the
								overloaded constructor you want to use. Using this attribute you can create a
								simple boot function that is executed only once during the whole application
								lifecycle and creates all managers/systems/services that you will need. This
								avoids the duplication conflict:</p>

								<img class="mb-3" src="../ReadmeImages/WithBootstrap.png" alt="">

								<p>An example of this can be a SystemBootstrap class with only one bootstrap function:</p>
								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/de657917b7e24062907eeeec9b81b69f.js"></script>

								<p>Registering a system behaviour will load
								the prefab from a resources folder and use it to instantiate a copy in the
								active scene. 

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/710fc1216e9ce68dcd3e132b4f76160c.js"></script>

								<p>The reference to the system behaviour
								component is added to a dictionary to provide other scripts with global
								availability of the system.</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/684c6e90956eef2a0492797bf57d2315.js"></script>

								<p>Interacting with a scene switch system would then be done like this: </p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/bf3e6b0b159452a683c430c2b50d8cfa.js"></script>

								<p>In addition to the fact that you will have
								to provide a resources folder with the different system prefabs, you will have
								to deal with the fact that, if not configured, <b>all</b> systems are created
								by default<b> </b>when the application starts. This might be annoying in some
								situations when you simply need to test a feature inside a test scene.</p>

								<h3>The bootstrap/initialization
								scene</h3>

								<p>Another method which uses the same
								principle as the bootstrap function is a bootstrap or initialization scene.
								This scene will contain all persistent game objects that need to be created
								when the application is started.</p>

								<p>You can use an editor only script to load
								this scene if it isn’t already. This way you can decide on whether you want
								your systems in your test scene or not.</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/46ba7f91a15ba1ad615000eb6474c281.js"></script>

								<h3>Scriptable Object Event System</h3>

								<p>There is another alternative, which solves
								many of the stated problems and has, as far as i have been able to test, only
								one downside. You can use a Scriptable Object Event System, in this case, for
								the purpose of providing a way of communication between manager and Actor
								behaviours as far as I can see it. You create channels (e.g. class
								SceneLoadEventChannel : ScriptableObject) that contain only two things. An
								event containing the arguments necessary for the channel to work and a function
								that raises the event. </p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/053550a7ed37ef3e2e5a0280a8b720da.js"></script>

								<p>A manager can listen to this channel
								through subscription and Actor behaviours can raise events to let the manager
								know something has to be managed.</p>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/8f0b795f3d2a160ff21e5ae9318070b0.js"></script>

								<script src="https://gist.github.com/Bvanderwolf/d118d606598bfb8256a23ded83ec667c.js"></script>

								<p>The nice thing about this relationship is
								that the channel creates a loose connection between manager and actor. A
								manager doesn’t have to be in the scene when an event is raised as part of some
								action an actor is doing. In addition to this, channels are easily created and
								referenced since the scriptable object is a project asset which can be
								referenced from anywhere.</p>

								<p>The downside however is that interaction
								between manager and actors is limited to raising events.</p>

								<p>Shared data will have to be stored in
								things like scriptable objects to provide actors with management information
								when necessary (e.g. whether a popup is active or audio is playing).</p>

								<h2>Conclusion</h2>

								<p>The default implementation of a singleton
								in Unity provides the developer with a lot of unnecessary challenges. Flags
								like appIsQuitting and isDuplicate don’t fix the underlying problems like
								script execution order, order of execution for event functions and the way
								Unity handles the lifecycle of game objects. Luckily, alternative solutions to
								this problem exist.</p>

								<p>Lazy initialization provides the developer
								with the opportunity to create singleton objects on demand, solving the problem
								of rigid connections and order of execution, but needs to use the notorious
								Resources folder to provide the necessary functionality of editor exposed
								fields.</p>

								<p>The bootstrap function provides the
								developer with the option to create all singleton objects at boot time and only
								once, solving the issue of duplication when returning to the starting scene. It
								does also need a Resource folder to provide it with the necessary resources to
								Instantiate these singleton objects making it a little less attractive.</p>

								<p>The bootstrap/initialization scene is also
								very clear in solving the issue of duplication of singleton objects. It does
								this by grouping the necessary systems inside an “initialization or bootstrap”
								scene, which is used to start your application from, but can also be loaded
								into a test scene if necessary.</p>

								<p>Lastly there is the Scriptable Object Event
								System approach where no singleton pattern is used, but channels create a loose
								connection between managers and actors, where the managers listens for events
								or requests and the actors can raise an event or request to make the managers
								do its job. The downside to this approach is that management data can not be
								exposed through the singleton instance and thus needs to be shared in some
								other way (e.g. scriptable objects). </p>

								<p>My conclusion therefore is: There is no one
								solution, there are just good alternatives.</p>
